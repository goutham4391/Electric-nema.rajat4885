NEMA highlighted meeting those timelines will require a robust and resilient supply chain. The country must address and strengthen U.S. supply chains so they are running to a point of predictably delivering necessary materials to transitioning markets. NEMA suggested reorganizing the supply chain itself and investing in research and development projects, such as a REE Demonstration Facility, to achieve optimal supply chain resilience.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="2"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The historic &lt;em&gt;Bipartisan Infrastructure Law&lt;/em&gt; (BIL) will help propel electrification of the American economy. &lt;/strong&gt;In our comments, NEMA suggested FECM considers how the Law&amp;rsquo;s investment can address &amp;ndash; and expand &amp;ndash; the country&amp;rsquo;s capacity for processing REEs and CMs. If the United States is going to have a chance at achieving its clean-energy goals, critical minerals will need to be involved. But, as the world undergoes an energy transition, the demand for these minerals will not only come from the United States, it will come from the entire world, experts note.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="3"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Manufacturers rely on the continuous availability of multiple REEs and CMs. &lt;/strong&gt;Currently, even when REEs and CMs are domestically mined, they are shipped overseas for processing, before being sold back here in more expensive products. For context, more than 80 percent of the nation&amp;rsquo;s REEs are imported; with China extracting roughly 65 percent of REEs but processing about 85 percent. Furthermore, NEMA identified, not only do manufacturers need the minerals for production, but the REEs and CMs are also key components in many of the commercial and consumer goods being used to decarbonize and modernize American infrastructure today &amp;ndash; such as advanced aircrafts, wind turbines, semiconductors, hydrogen fuel cells, and electric vehicles.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="4"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NEMA supports efforts to increase domestic supply of REEs and CMs in an environmentally conscious, equitable, and economically efficient manner. &lt;/strong&gt;NEMA noted the facility is being considered the &amp;ldquo;first-of-a-kind&amp;rdquo; in terms of producing rare earth elements and critical minerals from unconventional sources, such as coal waste. By cleaning up the legacy waste left behind from coal mining and related activities, the country can gain access to a wide variety of valuable minerals and materials. Across the United States, there are &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-launches-140-million-program-develop-americas-first-kind-critical-minerals-refinery" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;billions of tons&lt;/a&gt; of legacy waste and ash, acid mine drainage, and produced water. All of those individual locations offer an untapped resource for producing a wealth of critical minerals.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;ol start="5"&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Demonstration Facility is an opportunity for America to showcase the best it has to offer.&lt;/strong&gt; The structure itself models how the convergence of modern technology and building design can achieve decarbonization goals &amp;ndash; practically and to scale. NEMA encouraged FECM to prioritize and incorporate technologies in the facility that further other decarbonization policy outcomes. And in addition to expanding the RFI&amp;rsquo;s scope to include processing, NEMA recommends FECM incorporate capable and available domestic entities which can facilitate smaller workflows within the extraction process &amp;ndash; pushing the country closer to its decarbonization goal.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looking Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEMA believes the greatest outcome to be gained from this demonstration facility is insight on how domestic extraction and processing can be amplified broadly across this industry sector. While the facility may focus on the extraction of a few specific REEs and CMs, the outcomes and knowledge gained from this project should not be limited to just those materials.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access to domestically produced REEs and CMs would provide greater resilience to supply chains which incorporate these products. It would also reduce the added site-to-source greenhouse gas and carbon emissions created by an extended supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A country running on clean energy is possible, we just need to be willing to find the avenues that offer the most sustainability, longevity, and opportunity. And legacy waste may lead us there.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read NEMA's full comments &lt;a title="NEMA Comments REE Demo Facility RFI 3.31.22" href="[documents%7COpenAccessDataProvider]6f7ff4f1-7767-4c9c-a174-c341dbbc423a?sfvrsn=db18b857_0"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Spencer Pederson&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice President of Public Affairs, NEMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="_com_1" language="JavaScript"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:0b058690-71bd-42fd-90fa-3190f664b40f</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:921157e3-97dc-4008-9401-be388051ac9f</guid><author>Jena.Passut@nema.org</author><category>Infrastructure</category><category>Trade Agreements</category><category>Tariff Alert</category><title>NEMA Submits Statement to House Ways and Means Committee on Administration’s 2022 Trade Policy</title><description>By&amp;nbsp;Spencer Pederson, Vice President of Public Affairs, NEMAOn Wednesday, March 30, the House Ways and Means Committee held a&amp;nbsp;hearing&amp;nbsp;on the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s 2022 Trade Policy Agenda.While the electroindustry shares with the Administration the fundamental goal of creating well-paying American jobs and shoring up our domestic supply chains, NEMA</description><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2022 19:34:58 Z</pubDate><link>https://www.nema.org/podcast/podcastdetail//2022/03/30/nema-submits-statement-to-house-ways-and-means-committee-on-administration-s-2022-trade-policy</link><comments>https://www.nema.org/podcast/podcastdetail//2022/03/30/nema-submits-statement-to-house-ways-and-means-committee-on-administration-s-2022-trade-policy#comment-submit-287064a5-dd9a-475f-a5ca-53a99011c0c3_en</comments><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">NEMA Communications</dc:creator><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;By&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Spencer Pederson&lt;/strong&gt;, Vice President of Public Affairs, NEMA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, March 30, the House Ways and Means Committee held a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/legislation/hearings/biden-administration-s-2022-trade-policy-agenda" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;hearing&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the Biden Administration&amp;rsquo;s 2022 Trade Policy Agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the electroindustry shares with the Administration the fundamental goal of creating well-paying American jobs and shoring up our domestic supply chains, NEMA submitted a statement for the record to the committee outlining three key areas of focus as the Committee considers trade policy:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. Leadership in International Standards-Setting Organizations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, as U.S. Trade Representative continues its work to engage with key trading partners and multilateral institutions, NEMA urges the Administration to address growing concerns about declining U.S. involvement and influence in multilateral standards-setting organizations. Participation in development processes and technical standards-setting bodies are crucial to preserving and expanding international market access for U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to Materials Needed to Secure the Electric Grid and Support Electrical Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEMA believes any effort to bolster national security must not disrupt the very supply chain that ensures our ability to produce reliable, resilient, and affordable energy, including electrical transformers in the U.S. for the grid, as well as for industrial, commercial, and residential buildings. The supply chain for transformer cores and laminations is facing unprecedented challenges to meet demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the Administration receives requests to impose policies that would reduce U.S. imports of downstream GOES products from Canada and Mexico, we urge the Administration to consider the current state of the supply chain, the high demand for this material, and the potential detrimental impacts on U.S. citizens, our domestic base, and the infrastructure goals of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section 301 Tariff Relief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEMA member companies continue to experience supply chain disruptions and labor shortages. The results are inflationary pressures, which have disrupted domestic production, reduced sales, increased consumer costs, and delayed delivery of critical products. If these concerns are not addressed, they will have a negative impact on implementation of the IIJA. These supply chain issues require both near-term and long-term solutions and Congress and the Administration can help with both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the immediate term, the Biden Administration should use the looming expiration of List 1 of the Trump Administration&amp;rsquo;s Section 301 tariffs on Chinese imports as an opportunity to conduct a robust, thorough, and transparent review of the effectiveness of the full list of tariffs put in place in achieving their objectives and their impact on U.S. importers and consumers of electrical goods. And while USTR recently announced its decision to reinstate certain previously granted and extended product exclusions pursuant to the China Section 301 investigation, NEMA urges the Administration to fully restart and reform the Section 301 tariff exclusions process in a way that has clear eligibility standards for applicants, is transparent, and fair to all who apply.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read NEMA&amp;rsquo;s full statement here:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="[documents%7COpenAccessDataProvider]7389c532-7f5b-47bd-b582-ed4c532d47eb?sfvrsn=e1d28264_3" title="NEMA Statement for the Record 2022 Trade Policy Agenda Hearing" data-sf-ec-document-immutable="true"&gt;NEMA Statement for the Record 2022 Trade Policy Agenda Hearing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:921157e3-97dc-4008-9401-be388051ac9f</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:e24e7378-9323-4949-9699-8a11adbaf890</guid><author>bill.green@nema.org</author><title>NEMA Outlines Ways to Decarbonize ‘Difficult’ Industrial Sector</title><description>The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) recently submitted comments to the Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s Office of Energy Efficiency &amp;amp; Renewable Energy (EERE) in response to the Advanced Manufacturing Office&amp;rsquo;s (AMO) Request for Information (RFI) on Industrial Decarbonization Priorities.In the RFI, the AMO notes that the industrial sector may</description><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 18:11:55 Z</pubDate><link>https://www.nema.org/podcast/podcastdetail//2022/03/15/nema-outlines-ways-to-decarbonize-difficult-industrial-sector</link><comments>https://www.nema.org/podcast/podcastdetail//2022/03/15/nema-outlines-ways-to-decarbonize-difficult-industrial-sector#comment-submit-a8eec422-7ae6-40a7-ba53-58a6a40b4a80_en</comments><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">NEMA Communications</dc:creator><content:encoded xmlns:content="http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/">&lt;p&gt;The National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) recently submitted &lt;a href="[documents%7COpenAccessDataProvider]aef26a37-6bb9-43b7-b740-7dd2da1fc13e?sfvrsn=b84b29be_3"&gt;comments&lt;/a&gt; to the Department of Energy&amp;rsquo;s Office of Energy Efficiency &amp;amp; Renewable Energy (EERE) in response to the Advanced Manufacturing Office&amp;rsquo;s (AMO) &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/amo/articles/request-information-industrial-decarbonization" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Request for Information (RFI) on Industrial Decarbonization Priorities.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the RFI, the AMO notes that the industrial sector may be &amp;lsquo;difficult-to-decarbonize.&amp;rsquo; But difficult doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean impossible, and there are incremental steps we can take today. The electroindustry recognizes the importance and urgency of decarbonizing manufacturing and production processes as we work towards economy-wide emissions reductions. In our RFI response, NEMA highlighted areas where electroindustry technologies can help decarbonize the industrial sector:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Power Drive Systems, Lighting Controls, and Building Management Systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power Drive Systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outdated equipment and control systems can stall decarbonization. However, upgrading legacy equipment to modern, &amp;lsquo;smart manufacturing&amp;rsquo; Power Drive Systems (PDS) &amp;ndash; that are more energy efficient &amp;ndash; can reduce a system&amp;rsquo;s energy consumption. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help end-users achieve decarbonization goals and enable Smart Manufacturing technologies outlined in our comments, NEMA recently published the new &amp;ldquo;&lt;a href="https://www.nema.org/news-trends/view/nema-introduces-power-index-standard-to-help-end-users-achieve-decarbonization-goals-and-optimize-energy-savings" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;power index&amp;rdquo; (PI) standard&lt;/a&gt;. The standard introduces a PI metric, which allows PDS and drives to be compared for optimal energy savings for end-users. By utilizing the PI in their incentive programs, utilities and regulators can create significant energy savings for American businesses, schools, hospitals, and families &amp;ndash; launching the country towards a bright, electrified future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lighting Controls &amp;amp; Building Management Systems:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area where the electroindustry can facilitate decarbonization is buildings. NEMA shared three ways in our comments:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol type="1"&gt;&lt;li&gt;Upgrading old and inefficient building technologies with energy efficient management      systems &amp;ndash; the switch could save 30-50% of energy costs;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Installing readily available LED lighting systems that can reduce energy consumption      and carbon output up to 75%; &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;And structuring buildings to make them &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; by incorporating natural      light results in a 25% energy efficiency rating, compared to 2% from solar      panel systems. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can read NEMA's full comments &lt;a href="[documents%7COpenAccessDataProvider]aef26a37-6bb9-43b7-b740-7dd2da1fc13e?sfvrsn=b84b29be_3"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Fern Abrams&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;NEMA Industry Director, Industrial Systems and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Peter Ferrell&lt;/strong&gt;, Manager, Connectivity and Data Policy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:e24e7378-9323-4949-9699-8a11adbaf890</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:bd4c5467-1383-4a3e-9c2b-6adffc2264e3</guid><author>Jena.Passut@nema.org</author><category>Blog</category><category>Energy</category><title>DOE Proposes to Revise the Process Improvement Rule (Again)</title><description>On April 12, the Department of Energy (DOE) published proposed modifications to its Process Improvement Rule of February 2020.

The proposal responds to a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/regulatory-freeze-pending-review/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Memorandum&lt;/a&gt; from the White House Chief of Staff directing agencies to review several rulemaking outcomes from the previous Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Before issuance of the February 2020 rule, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) and other trade associations argued the original Process Improvement Rule of 1996 was sorely out-of-date, and its guidance had been interpreted and reinterpreted so many times it was no longer relevant. A practice of &amp;ldquo;energy-savings-at-all-costs&amp;rdquo; seemed to be in effect, ignorant of diminishing returns on mature product Standards.&amp;nbsp; The February 2020 Rule made several important changes, including making the process rule&amp;rsquo;s provisions mandatory, finalizing test procedures ahead of new proposed Standards, increasing transparency, and encouraging rapid assessment of previous rulemaking conclusions (aka &amp;ldquo;quick look&amp;rdquo;).&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New DOE leadership in the Biden Administration is seeking to overturn the provisions of the February 2020 rule without considering its benefits for the Agency itself.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As required by the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, Standards must be &amp;ldquo;economically feasible&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;technologically justified.&amp;rdquo; DOE rulemakings entail the investment of significant staff time and financial resources to determine the positive and negative impacts of a range of potential Standards levels. The resulting analytical reviews then assess the best point at which to strike the balance of positive energy savings versus negative national impacts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of the February 2020 Process Rule imply that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; energy saved or &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; energy consumption reduced is sufficient to justify tighter regulations for that sector. However, it is worth remembering that most proponents of energy-savings-at-all-costs bear little to no stake or burden in the development or implementation of those Standards. A central purpose of the Process Rule is to reduce inefficient use of government resources and prevent the undue burden of its regulations. Like all agencies, DOE must prioritize its resources and is obliged to apply them where they can provide the most benefit. The simple &amp;ldquo;quick look&amp;rdquo; is an excellent tool to allow DOE to assess whether factors such as technological breakthroughs, market transformation, or other changes to market dynamics have occurred, which might warrant deeper investigation by DOE analysts.&amp;nbsp; In contrast, where little or no change in the factors that determined previous conclusions have taken place there would be little benefit from a more thorough investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEMA supports DOE efforts to implement congressional intent to improve the energy efficiency of appliances, products, and systems.

The study&amp;rsquo;s in-depth details will inform numerous activities and industries, assisting in planning and decision-making. This NEMA analysis focuses on the regulatory impacts of the MSMA and how NEMA (and other entities) may use it to inform and influence US Department of Energy rulemakings for minimum energy conservation Standards for electric motors.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Examines Operating Characteristics of Electric Motors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBNL) MSMA is the first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt; of three research papers that examine the installed base of electric motors in the US and their operating characteristics. This study is an update to a similar investigation published in 2002. This paper aims to examine the study results and findings with respect to their potential use in and influence on US Department of Energy (DOE) rulemakings for minimum energy conservation Standards. Electric motors themselves are a regulated product class&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;, and electric motors appear as components in dozens of other regulated product classes as well.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LBNL authors describe the scope of the study as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSMA covered all three-phase AC and DC motors greater than and including one horsepower (hp). Advanced motor technologies, such as synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet, were also included (as AC motors). Fractional horsepower motors (motors &amp;lt; one hp) were excluded because they are often embedded within components, and it would be difficult to assess their installed base comprehensively. Further, excluding these motors aligns with the scope of the previous assessment. The assessments encompassed the drive, motor, transmission, end-use equipment, and distribution system (e.g., compressed air lines, water pipes). The types of end-use equipment evaluated included: pumps, fans/blowers, air compressors, refrigeration compressors, materials handling, and materials conveying. Motor systems that utilize non-electric energy sources (e.g., fossil fuels) were not part of the assessment scope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electric Motors in the Industrial and Commercial Sector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of overall national electricity consumption, the study notes industrial and commercial three-phase motor systems greater than or equal to one hp consume ~1,079 terawatt-hours (TWh)/year,&lt;em&gt; about 29 percent of the total electric grid load&lt;/em&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the industrial space, in 1994, electric motor systems were responsible for 679 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) of yearly electricity consumption, but by 2020 this decreased to 547 billion kilowatt-hours. The study notes various potential reasons for this, the most prominent being offshoring of industrial production and gains in energy efficiency. This 547 B kWh represents 69 percent of all electricity consumption in this space.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;In the commercial space, in 1995, electric motor systems were responsible for 343 billion kWh of yearly electricity consumption, but by 2020 this figure grew to 532 billion kWh.This 532 b kWh represents about 43 percent of all electricity consumption in this space.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reading the study&amp;rsquo;s executive summary, proponents of increased Federal regulation of electric motors might start typing excited demands for more DOE rulemakings, but their enthusiasm would be premature and misplaced. The study notes 48 percent of all commercial sector motor system electricity consumption is for refrigeration compressors (e.g., chillers, air conditioners), and refrigeration compressor use &lt;em&gt;accounts for 94 percent&lt;/em&gt; of the commercial sector&amp;rsquo;s motor system electricity consumption. The aforementioned products are &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; regulated by the DOE. The situation is less imbalanced in the industrial sector where 29 percent of all motor system electricity consumption is for materials processing, followed by 21 percent for pumps and fans/blowers each. Pumps and fans/blowers are also regulated systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study notes that there are 52.5 million motor systems greater than or equal to one hp in the industrial and commercial sectors, with 10.8 million in industrial and 41.7 million in commercial facilities.&amp;nbsp; The average connected motor system horsepower at an industrial facility is 1,595 hp &amp;nbsp;and 89 hp for the commercial sector.&amp;nbsp; The average motor size is 27 hp for industrial and eight hp for commercial. So, while commercial facilities use more motors and industrial facilities use more horsepower, they both consume similar amounts of electricity (547 B kWh industrial and 532 B kWh commercial).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A quick note about DC motors: &amp;ldquo;It is estimated that there are 806,000 DC motor systems greater than or equal to 1 hp consuming 31,000 GWh annually in the industrial and commercial sectors. This represents 2 percent of all motors and 3 percent of total annual motor system electricity consumption in the industrial and commercial sectors.&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp; This sounds small, but three percent of over one trillion kWh (the preceding two electricity consumption figures) cannot be dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regarding the horsepower ratings of motors in studied facilities: Ninety-nine percent of the motor system units in the industrial sector are in the one to 500 hp range, with 49 percent in the one to five hp range. Ninety-nine percent of the motor system units in the commercial sector are in the one to 50 hp size range. This begs the question of whether there is any worthwhile benefit to raising the upper bound of regulations, as some have proposed in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning expansion or increased stringency of existing DOE electric motor regulations, NEMA has commented more than once to DOE that there is no guarantee that improving the efficiency of any given component&amp;mdash;in this case the electric motor&amp;mdash;of a regulated product will make that product more efficient. A more efficient motor spins faster for a given input (design horsepower does not change since the &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt; the motor is needed to perform does not bow to efficiency demands). Also, many efficiency improvement options add mass or increase the physical size of motors. Changes to the disposition and performance of any component factor into overall system/appliance design, and during design development, tradeoffs often occur. In the end, these regulated products and systems are not guaranteed to become more efficient if their electric motors become so.&amp;nbsp; Rather, designers will naturally perform technical and cost engineering trade-offs with only the final overall efficiency requirements and regulations in mind.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEMA has also commented in past DOE rulemakings that how motor systems are loaded in end-use applications factors heavily into whether a more efficient motor will yield any practical reductions in electricity consumption. Since electricity consumption is application-dependent, NEMA has encouraged DOE to pursue systems efficiency regulations and support programs to encourage better application of these systems. With regard to loading: In the industrial space, 27 percent of industrial sector motor system electricity consumption operates at variable&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; load, with load factors between 40 percent and 75 percent, while 42 percent of industrial sector motor system units operate at constant loads greater than 75 percent of full load. In the commercial space, 35 percent of commercial sector motor system electricity consumption operates at variable load, with load factors between 40 percent and 75 percent. At the same time, 30 percent of commercial sector motor system units operate at variable loads, with load factors between 40 percent and 75 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very little motor system electricity consumption takes place at load factors under 40 percent load. The study notes only six percent of industrial sector motor system electricity consumption, and eight percent of the industrial motor systems operate under 40 percent load factor.&amp;nbsp; Additionally, across all driven equipment types in the industrial sector, the most common operating condition is estimated to be constant motor load systems operating at 0.75 load factor. For the commercial sector, the most common operating conditions are very different, with 60 percent of commercial motor system electricity consumption attributable to variably loaded motors, and 35 percent is attributable to constantly loaded motors. It is worth recalling the above observation that many of these variable load conditions involve HVAC, compressors, pumps, fans/blowers, and other DOE-regulated systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning load control: on average, 16 percent of motor system capacity at an industrial facility use variable frequency drives (VFDs), and 74 percent have no load control technology/equipment. Further, the rate of installation of VFDs and other load control technologies in the industrial and commercial sectors increases with motor system size. On average, four percent of motor system capacity at a commercial facility use VFDs, and 91 percent have no load control technology/equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study notes the uptake of VFDs by driven equipment type in the &lt;em&gt;industrial&lt;/em&gt; sector is nearly uniform, at about 23 percent of electricity consumption for each equipment type, with most operating using temperature or pressure setpoints as the control mechanism. While the uptake of VFDs by driven equipment type in the &lt;em&gt;commercial&lt;/em&gt; sector varies but is highest for fan/blower systems with the most common metric for VFD control being pressure setpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The above numbers raise suspicion that increased application of VFDs could benefit the commercial sector and even more the industrial sector.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, there are some entities who believe energy efficiency requirements for the drives themselves are appropriate, for instance, the IEC.&amp;nbsp; However, one must bear in mind that the addition of a VFD does not guarantee overall efficiency gains depending on the system and how it is used (i.e., near or at full-load would not benefit from a VFD). Efficiency gains from incorporation of VFDs do sound possible, but they will be application- and load-dependent.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Considering justification or opportunity for further DOE component regulations, it is important to revisit the preceding reference to pressure and temperature setpoints being the most common control metrics. These types of metrics are most commonly associated with air, water, and HVAC systems&amp;mdash;systems that are already regulated for overall efficiency by the DOE. It is not clear from the initial study results in the US Industrial and Commercial Motor System Market Assessment Report Volume 1 (the subject of this paper) whether notable gains are feasible in the remaining portions of these system loads. Follow-up papers (two more are in progress) will more fully investigate this question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than interpret the above data points as justification for mandatory incorporation of drives on motors, or that VFD Standards should be written, one must respect the variety of applications. Instead, efforts should be made to accelerate and incent programs to educate and equip industrial and commercial facilities with VFDs where they are appropriate. A point-of-sale regulation from the DOE cannot accomplish this, but the DOE has other programs, and it can and should add VFD options to them. One example of a better approach for in-the-field energy efficiency improvements is the joint program founded by NEMA and the American Council for an Energy-Efficienct Economy (ACEEE) known as the Extended Motor Products (XMP) program.&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt; The DOE Building Technologies Office (BTO) could help promote XMP nationwide. NEMA and its Motor and Generator Section Members invested several years&amp;rsquo; effort with other interested parties to launch the XMP and more can and should be done to expand participation nationwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study makes these observations about its own results: &amp;ldquo;Further, since these [initial 1990s] results were published, the US manufacturing sector has undergone a massive transformation. Due to global competition, some sectors have relocated operations overseas. Others have brought operations onshore to avail low cost and abundant natural gas. Additionally, automation and robotics have pervaded the entire sector.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Consequently, these two reports likely do not represent the current state of motor-driven systems in US industrial and commercial facilities. [&amp;hellip;]&amp;nbsp; Specifically, the lack of information affects a range of stakeholders: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Governments must rely on outdated information when setting research agendas, developing policies, and designing energy efficiency programs and offerings.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Utilities and energy efficiency programs cannot identify the current market needs or potential impact when designing rebate and energy efficiency programs.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Electric grid planners cannot identify motor system usage characteristics when developing plans to support the resilience of the electric grid.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Manufacturers of motors, motor-driven equipment, and drives are hampered when developing technologies to meet the needs of their market.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Motor system end users are limited in their ability to identify energy-saving opportunities within their own facilities because they do not have reliable benchmark information.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lack of information or freedom of choice implied in any regulatory outcomes from the preceding five impact statements begs the question of whether further DOE regulations can improve outcomes. DOE regulatory reach can only impact reported efficiency of a product or appliance at its entry point into the market, whether manufactured domestically or imported.&amp;nbsp; DOE regulatory effect ends well before the end-use application of motor-driven systems. Since efficiency gains are more likely, and more beneficial, at the end-use, programs like the XMP program would seem more appropriate than other regulatory actions&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;. This approach would further build on the excellent energy savings already made by electric motor product class energy efficiency Standards. DOE has other programs that encourage better buildings, retrofits, and other improvements, but these are independent of its regulatory offices, and regulators often feel obliged to produce regulations even if they are not completely justified or may not be very effective.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to what is already being practiced with respect to reducing electricity consumption, the study notes the following findings from a survey of facility contacts: 59 percent of industrial facilities use an external energy assessor. Peer-to-peer knowledge sharing is used by 27 percent of all industrial facilities, and it is the most common method for large facilities (66 percent). Similarly, utility resources are used by 33 percent of all industrial facilities, but more often by large facilities than small facilities. Across all commercial facilities, peer-to-peer knowledge sharing is the most common method for identifying energy-efficiency measures&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The study provides excellent detailed reviews of motors and their disposition in the field by sector, by facility type, facility size, loading, disposition, and so on. This substantial amount of information (the report is 252 pages) cannot all be captured here. But NEMA staff has reviewed the report in detail and made extensive notes for future reference during DOE rulemaking proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concerning DOE rulemakings, the MSMA will be very useful to all interested participants in the currently &lt;em&gt;open&lt;/em&gt; rulemaking for electric motor energy conservation Standards.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://nemaorg137-my.sharepoint.com/personal/jena_passut_nema_org/Documents/Desktop/PORTAL%20NEMA%20Review%20and%20Analysis%20of%20DOE%20LBNL%20Motor%20System%20Market%20Assessment%20Feb2021%20v3.docx#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt; This rulemaking is a mandatory six-year review of Standards, and the three MSMA reports and findings about the status of the market and how the market has changed will help inform the DOE and other rulemaking participants whether and where additional opportunities may exist for further investigation by DOE and others.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Study Helps NEMA Members&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSMA provides a detailed look into the population, electricity consumption and applications of electric motors in the US as well as insight into the facilities that employ these motors. Besides the regulatory applications this paper focuses on, the data and insights provided can aid NEMA Members in making business and planning decisions. The apparent low VFD deployment identifies opportunities for sales and upgrades outreach. The low rates of investment in facility energy efficiency programs and practices identifies opportunities for energy savings contracts and other improvement programs, whether private or government-sponsored. For NEMA Staff the MSMA provides useful insight into where Standards and other technical activities may be needed. Lastly, the study will provide rich context and useful data to contribute to better-informed and more effective consensus comments to DOE rulemakings on behalf of Members.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Section 1007 of the bill, titled &amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em style="background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;"&gt;Smart Building Acceleration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="background-color:transparent;color:inherit;font-family:inherit;font-size:inherit;text-align:inherit;text-transform:inherit;white-space:inherit;word-spacing:normal;caret-color:auto;"&gt;,&amp;rdquo; directs the Department of Energy (DOE) in consultation with the General Services Administrator (GSA), to establish a Federal Smart Building Program to implement smart building technology and demonstrate the costs and benefits of smart buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new law&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defines a &amp;ldquo;smart building&amp;rdquo; as a building, or collection of buildings, with an energy system that is flexible and automated; has extensive operational monitoring and communication connectivity, allowing remote monitoring and analysis of all building functions; and takes a systems-based approach integrating the overall building operations for control of energy generation, consumption, and storage. A smart building also communicates with utilities and other third-party commercial entities; protects the health and safety of occupants and workers; and incorporates cybersecurity best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOE will follow Federal Energy Management Program guidelines to evaluate which advanced building technologies are most cost-effective and show the most promise for increasing building energy savings, increasing service performance, and reducing environmental impacts. The program will also survey privately-owned smart buildings throughout the United States and work with private-sector property owners through the Better Buildings Challenge to develop smart building accelerators. These accelerators are initiatives that will demonstrate innovative policies and approaches to speed the transition to smart buildings in public, institutional, and commercial buildings sectors.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The General Services Administration (GSA) Green Building Advisory Committee established a Data-Integrated Building Systems (DIBS) &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/DIBS%20Advice%20Letter%2011-12-19.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Task Group&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to identify opportunities and challenges in leveraging DIBS to improve Federal buildings&amp;rsquo; performance. Performance benefits include reduced energy use and enhanced indoor environmental quality, occupant health and performance, and organizational effectiveness. The task group found that Federal implementation of DIBS lags due to procurement guidelines that favor standalone systems, risk aversion in the contracting chain, and cybersecurity concerns. Other significant challenges include the lack of training and education, interoperability standards, systems specification and procurement guidelines, and life-cycle cost and impact data.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, the provisions in Section 1007 address a number of the DIBS task group&amp;rsquo;s recommendations. These include implementing demonstration projects in Federal buildings to quantify the costs and benefits of smart building installations, supporting systems interoperability Standards development and testing, investigating cybersecurity concerns, and providing guidance for system specification, maintenance, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the challenges in implementation, the market for smart building technology is increasing. In the 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/-/media/jci/corp/media/news/files/2020/2020_eei_survey.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Energy Efficiency Indicator study&lt;/a&gt; of U.S. facility and energy management executives, 56 percent of respondents said they planned to invest in building system integration in the next 12 months. Another 29 percent of organizations plan to invest in integrating building technology systems with the utility grid in 2021, up from 13 percent in 2020. One of the key drivers of this market demand is the importance of reducing energy use and carbon emissions in buildings.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent &lt;a href="https://euagenda.eu/publications/smart-buildings-decoded" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; in Europe estimates that smart building technology can save up to 23 percent of office buildings&amp;rsquo; energy use. In another &lt;a href="https://aceee.org/topic-brief/eo-building-systems" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt;, integrated building systems including heating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC), lighting and plug-loads were estimated to save eight to 18 percent. In the Better Buildings &lt;a href="https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/resources/proving-business-case-building-analytics-results-smart-energy-analytics-campaign" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;Smart Energy Analytics Campaign&lt;/a&gt;, Energy Information Systems achieved a median three percent in energy cost savings across 100 organizations. Fault Detection and Diagnostic applications saved an additional nine percent of energy costs, resulting in a combined two-year payback on investment. Another &lt;a href="https://www.buildingefficiencyinitiative.org/sites/default/files/intelligent-efficiency_issue-brief.pdf" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; evaluated 58 smart building measures and predicted more than 25 percent annual energy and maintenance savings from measures with less than a five-year payback.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the increased market demand for smart buildings, NEMA has established a &lt;a href="[f669d9a7-009d-4d83-ddaa-000000000002]994FABC8-419F-40E8-A424-C9A21A2BF7E7/building-systems"&gt;Connected Building Systems&lt;/a&gt; Section that focuses on &lt;a href="[f669d9a7-009d-4d83-ddaa-000000000002]F6AF03C2-75DD-4654-9E0D-CA39C5074778/avoid-integration-issues-with-bms-specifications"&gt;thought leadership&lt;/a&gt;, outreach, and the development of codes, Standards, and policy. UL and the Telecommunications Industry Association have just introduced the &lt;a href="https://spiresmartbuildings.ul.com/" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;SPIRE&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Smart Building evaluation and verification program which covers power and energy, health and safety, life and property safety, connectivity, cybersecurity, and sustainability.

Standby power is the energy needed by a device to be ready to respond to an outside query or control signal while the device is otherwise not performing its primary function. The SI also focused on developing industry guidance for regulators about the standby power requirements of connected devices that offer edge computing, cybersecurity protection, monitoring, and other always-on functionality.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As NEMA Members (and other industries) develop more IoT systems that include intelligent edge computing systems and cybersecurity protections, the power requirements to support these connected systems and their services may increase. We are concerned that regulatory bodies might stifle innovation and strand Member investments to develop these technologies through overly restrictive standby power allowances.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We investigated known test procedures for standby power energy consumption, examined those test procedures and Standards for NEMA Standards work opportunities, cataloged the regulatory bodies exhibiting interest or making efforts to examine or establish standby power regulatory limits, developed strategies to engage those regulators, and developed supporting advocacy materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With several other trade associations, previous NEMA advocacy cautioned regulatory bodies against inadvertently or purposefully excluding connected devices from full participation in the network environment, urging them to wait for IoT and IIoT environments to evolve into a more stable structure.&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due in part to our advocacy efforts, the complexity of connected device demands, and the global COVID-19 pandemic, attention on standby power has ebbed over the past year.&amp;nbsp; This does not mean interest will not rise&amp;mdash;a possibility if there is a new U.S. President&amp;mdash;and it does not mean NEMA will be idle. Since regulators are not currently promoting standby power regulations, NEMA has the opportunity to develop more Standards (recommended by the SI) and, when appropriate, use those references along with gathered data for proactive promotion of appropriate requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

The half-life measures the time required for the isotope to decay to half its strength. With each half-life, the radioactive level weakens by half. I have often applied a similar concept to my personal and business life, i.e., the &amp;ldquo;half-life of a champion.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s set the stage. You, your boss, or maybe an associate, champion new technology, a new process, or a new concept. The concept develops and becomes a success with viable results, spurred on by the champion&amp;rsquo;s work. Then, the&amp;nbsp; champion &amp;ldquo;disappears.&amp;rdquo; He may be promoted to a new job or move to a new endeavor as a reward for his success. She may find another concept that she feels more compelled to champion. The point is, the champion is gone. His departure creates a void in the leadership that guided the new concept to success. Her involvement could have led to technical work to study and develop the idea or the vision and drive for the original concept. It could also have led to the sponsorship that gave the concept the fuel and support to make it happen. Whatever the benefit or contribution was, the champion was the key to success. With the champion&amp;rsquo;s departure, who will take over the responsibility with the same vision, drive, knowledge, or passion for continuing its success? Without the champion or a suitable successor, the concept probably begins to decline, is slowly replaced by a new concept with a new champion, or falls dormant. Its contribution and its duration decay depending on the strength and resilience of the concept; its half-life. Ergo its life-cycle becomes associated with the half-life of the champion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brunt of the concept development stays with or falls on the champion. So, when the champion moves on, there is no one with the same conviction or passion for doing the work. In many cases, the champion did not share their full knowledge or development workload with other associates. Maybe the champion had a massive ego and the need to control the development and garner success. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s that concept projects are not staffed by many people, and those assigned to it also have other workloads and responsibilities. Many times, the champion&amp;rsquo;s successor has his projects, favorites, or agenda he wishes to champion. Unless the concept has been fully vetted, developed, and built to a self-preservation level, it will decline. This is where the half-life of a champion comes into play.&amp;nbsp; How long will the concept survive? What is its half-life? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find a successor to be a successful &amp;ldquo;successor-champion.&amp;rdquo; The champion, or champions in the case of a team, had the true vision and passion to develop and see their concept reach a successful plateau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All too many great technologies, processes, concepts fall prey to this half-life of the champion syndrome. It causes many businesses substantial incurred costs that do not receive their due return on investment. The few that succeed have reached an elevated plateau where they are self-sustaining. Champions can take steps to transfer the concept vitality and knowledge to a broader base of potential successors by sharing more responsibility and knowledge during the concept development process so that its value and success are more tangible for future purview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to take steps to extend the half-life of the concept. Ultimately all concepts are developed and implemented to benefit some end-user, i.e., a customer who will benefit from the concept&amp;rsquo;s continuation. To extend the half-life, make sure these customers are intimately involved in the development process, want the idea to succeed for their benefit, and take ownership of the concept, thus ensuring its longevity and continued success. Of course, the half-life of these customers also becomes a variable in the project's overall longevity and vitality. If these customer-champions can not be developed, the original concept may have an extremely short half-life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a champion? How can you make your legacy half-life of a champion stronger and less susceptible to decay?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;This blog was written by Tip Goodwin.

As of the writing of this report, a total of 17 named storms, five hurricanes, and one major hurricane have developed during this season. This season is also the first to see seven named tropical cyclones make landfall in the continental U.S. before the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hurricane Laura was a deadly and damaging Category 4 hurricane that tied with the 1856 Last Island hurricane as the strongest hurricane on record to make landfall in the state of Louisiana, with sustained winds of 150 MPH. The twelfth named storm, fourth hurricane, and the first major hurricane of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season, Laura originated from a massive tropical wave that moved off the West African coast on August 16, intensifying into a tropical storm on August 20. Early on August 27, Laura made landfall near peak intensity over Cameron, Louisiana, becoming the tenth-strongest U.S. hurricane landfall on record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Approximately 1.2-million customers lost power during the storm, with 615,000 power outages in Louisiana alone. Several coastal and barrier island communities experienced damaging storm surges more than 10-feet above sea level, and many low-lying inland communities were impacted by flash flooding due to torrential rains. Early damage assessments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) indicate that insured and uninsured losses will exceed $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NEMA Natural Disaster Team&amp;mdash;consisting of staff from the Field Representative Program, Communications, and Brand Management, and Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFi)&amp;mdash;activated our Natural Disaster Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) to coordinate NEMA activities. We gave electrical professionals, emergency management officials, and community decision-makers the most current guidance and other resources on policies and best practices for the selection and installation of electrical products that are resilient to natural disasters. We also offered advice on how to restore electrical systems after a natural disaster has passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEMA staff utilized digital technology to maximize our outreach efforts by posting guidance and links to the &lt;a href="https://www.nema.org/storm-disaster-recovery"&gt;NEMA Storm Reconstruction Toolkit&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.esfi.org/disaster-safety"&gt;ESFi Disaster Safety&lt;/a&gt; webpage on our social media accounts and in email blasts out to industry contacts in the impacted states. Special attention was paid to safe generator use as we learned that 15 deaths were reported as a result of carbon monoxide CO poisoning due to unsafe portable generator use. We also placed strong emphasis on avoiding downed power lines and making sure electrical equipment impacted&amp;nbsp; by rain or flood waters are properly evaluated for damage prior to reenergizing, using the &lt;a href="https://www.nema.org/Standards/view/Evaluating-Water-Damaged-Electrical-Equipment"&gt;NEMA GD 1-2019 Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Six NEMA Member companies with facilities in the impacted regions of Louisiana and Texas were contacted to offer guidance, intelligence from the field, and any other resources necessary to be of assistance to the staff and operations at those facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
With more than 80 days remaining in the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season ending on November 30, NEMA remains vigilant and ready to respond to any future landfalling storms.</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:267a4744-345e-4e1b-94d9-da57d9832da9</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:6a5cac08-5b8e-4b5c-897b-3779641f4934</guid><author>Jena.Passut@nema.org</author><category>Building Systems</category><category>Technical &amp; Safety</category><title>Hurricane Isaias Sets off Atlantic Hurricane Season</title><description>The ninth tropical cyclone of the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season developed on July 28, approximately 600 miles east of the Leeward Islands.

With its landfall on August 3, Hurricane Isaias became the earliest fifth named storm on record to make landfall on the U.S. mainland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the storm&amp;rsquo;s slow development and asymmetrical geometry, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina were mostly spared any significant impacts as the storm passed, never making landfall along these territories and states. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 3, the storm developed into a Category 1 hurricane with 85 MPH winds just before making landfall near Ocean Isle Beach, North Carolina. The storm then tracked northeast following the Interstate 95 corridor, impacting not less than 13 states before exiting into Canada on August 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three million customers lost power during the storm, with 1.1-million power outages in New Jersey alone. Several coastal communities in North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey experienced damaging storm surge, and many low-lying inland communities were impacted by flash flooding due to torrential rains. Early damage assessments from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) indicate that insured and uninsured losses will exceed $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NEMA Natural Disaster Team, consisting of staff from the Field Representative Program, Communications and Brand Management, and Electrical Safety Foundation International (ESFI), activated our Natural Disaster Standard Operating Procedures.

Additionally, Technical Director Megan Hayes and Senior Field Representative Bryan Holland co-presented a session on &amp;ldquo;The Link Between Community Resiliency and Codes and Standards&amp;rdquo; during the 69th Annual Society for Standards Professionals (SES) Virtual Conference. The purpose of this session was to discuss how emerging technologies and best practices should be incorporated into Codes and Standards to enhance and improve community resiliency to natural disasters, human-made disasters, and other societal hazards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 112 days remaining in the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season, which ends on November 30, NEMA remains vigilant and ready to respond to any future landfalling storms. Colorado State University has raised the 2020 Atlantic Hurricane Season forecast to 24 named storms. This means another 15 named storms after Isaias are expected to develop this hurricane season with 10 of those storms being forecast to become hurricanes and five of those hurricanes reaching at least Category 3 intensity. This could be the second most active hurricane season in recorded history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BE PREPARED. HAVE A PLAN.

To top it off, the industry is at the forefront of a global pandemic, with COVID-19 pushing to the limit its staff, infrastructures, and operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is little doubt that the current crisis will only accentuate trends that are reshaping the industry such as telehealth adoption, the rise of robotics, and the growing use of data and artificial intelligence. As healthcare facilities evolve in the process, NEMA has an important role to play in driving change and assisting the healthcare industry in its transition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, to provide assistance that is both effective and impactful, we need to better understand the unmet needs of our customers, the details of the transformation they are&amp;nbsp; going through, the problems they face in the field, and how we can best assist while limiting operational disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, NEMA has launched the Healthcare Facilities Council to address the unique and specialized unmet needs in the U.S. healthcare facilities market. The Council will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;establish a forum for professionals from different trades to share knowledge and best practices in the area of healthcare facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;create a better understanding of healthcare facility trends, codes and Standards gaps, government policies, and other opportunities to support Council Members&amp;rsquo; businesses&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;provide an avenue for Council Members to initiate projects to bridge those gaps for the betterment of the healthcare, electrical, and medical imaging industries&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the Healthcare Facilities Council will increase business opportunities for NEMA Members and help improve healthcare facilities by:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;attracting and retaining Council Members with expertise across industries and trades to identify issues encountered in the building, maintenance, and retrofit of healthcare facilities&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;engaging Council Members to identify technological, technical, legislative, and regulatory solutions to address those issues&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;leveraging NEMA staff and resources to initiate and execute projects that will help deliver such solutions&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about the Healthcare Facilities Council and its planned activities, email Marc Neufcourt, Industry Director, NEMA Building Systems Division, at&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:marc.neufcourt@nema.org" class="arialabel"&gt;marc.neufcourt@nema.org.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:2a871a25-fbeb-4c57-9955-cc2a8d853ef1</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:5daf7fd1-e160-4c90-9bd3-035da231fcf7</guid><author>npolara@affirma.com</author><category>Uncategorized</category><category>Sustainability</category><title>All-Electric Buildings: Electrification in the Code</title><description>This piece was originally published in the July/August 2020 issue of electroindustry.

&lt;p&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;Mike Stone&lt;/strong&gt;, West Coast Field Representative, NEMA&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Member companies have made possible the electrification of the country. What the term &amp;ldquo;electrification&amp;rdquo; has meant traditionally is to provide electricity to areas that previously did not have service. In the late 19th and first part of the 20th centuries, providing electricity to all parts of the country, including rural areas, was the challenge. The products and technology supplied by NEMA Members successfully met that challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, though, the term electrification has taken on a new meaning. Now it also refers to the use of electricity to power buildings, replacing natural gas, fuel oil, and other non-electrical sources of energy in buildings. Appliances and other equipment used for heating, cooking, air conditioning, refrigeration, and vehicles are all candidates for electrification in homes and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Building energy codes have historically favored the onsite usage of natural gas over electricity. These codes have been primarily concerned with the efficiency of the energy source without regard to the environmental impact of its generation. Much modern natural gas- fired equipment is highly efficient when it comes to energy usage. As a result, equipment such as electric water heaters and electric resistance heating have been less often used. Technologies such as electric heat pumps are changing that, but natural gas still is prevalent in buildings built under today&amp;rsquo;s energy codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural gas is one of the cleanest burning fossil fuels when compared to others such as coal or oil, and technology has helped improve its environmental impact. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) states that natural gas accounted for 39 percent of U.S. electricity generation in 2019, followed by coal at 23 percent. Also, in 2019, renewable energy sources accounted for 17 percent of generation and 11 percent of energy consumption. (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But regardless of how clean technology can make the burning of natural gas and other fossil fuels, emissions and other environmental impacts will never be reduced to zero. Renewables, on the other hand, produce no emissions in operation. Hydroelectric and geothermal are two types of renewables that have been used for generations ever since electricity was first harnessed for use. Their capacity for significant expansion, though, is limited. The greatest expansions of renewable energy have been solar photovoltaic (PV) and wind. Other technologies such as biomass and tidal energy are also promising, but wind and solar PV have been, and will likely continue to be, the primary sources of at-scale renewable electricity generation for the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Various energy codes across the country are beginning to address the concept of electrification. These codes include the International Code Council&amp;rsquo;s (ICC) International Energy Conservation Code (IECC), the ICC International Green Construction Code (IgCC), ASHRAE 90.1, and California&amp;rsquo;s Title 24 Part 6 Energy Code and Part 11 Green Construction Code (CALGreen). At the 2021 IECC code development hearings last year, NEMA assisted one of our industry partners in drafting an electrification proposal which was ultimately successful. This new code language requires that any appliance location in a dwelling unit that has a natural gas supply must also be provided with an equivalent electrical circuit. As of this writing, several of the opponents to this code change have filed an appeal with ICC to have it removed. But if the appeal is denied, the new requirement will be in the 2021 IECC edition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The State of California does not have electrification requirements in its current edition of the Title 24 Energy Code or CALGreen. However, the California Energy Commission (CEC) is currently discussing electrification, and there will likely be electrification provisions in the next editions of both the Energy Code and CALGreen, which will be effective on January 1, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other related activities, the newly formed NEMA Solar Photovoltaic Council is working with Members and other outside solar PV industry partners on areas of mutual interest. One of the projects underway is the creation of a new Standard for PV wire connectors. NEMA involvement in the solar PV industry will undoubtedly help advance the technologies that will enable the expansion of the use of solar PV renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy codes in various forms have existed in this country since the 1970s and have been a significant factor in the decline of energy consumption in buildings. But electrification goes beyond efficiency to address the sources of the energy that we use. Less reliance on direct fossil fuel use in buildings in favor of electricity, and cleaner fossil fuel generation augmented by a growing amount of renewable generation, means fewer overall emissions and an executable incremental step toward a cleaner environment. Through technology and innovation, NEMA and its Members continue to lead the way. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each year the NEMA Strategic Initiatives program generates valuable market research, technical and policy reports, websites, educational toolkits, and more for the benefit of NEMA Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2020 Strategic Initiatives (SI) cover topics related to digitalization and the Internet of Things, market development, resilience, and workforce development. One example of a 2020 initiative is NEMA.Lab. This SI will establish a cross-domain, technology-based knowledge development, capture, and sharing forum on artificial intelligence (AI) and the future of wireless communication (5G). It will also research how these technologies will impact the next normal after COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An AI research white paper is being developed for electrical equipment manufacturers. This document will discuss items such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;needed architecture for AI implementation and Standards gaps&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;relevant current and future use cases/ applications&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;technology adoption trends&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;criteria manufacturers might wish to apply when making decisions to further automate processes&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;challenges that apply across all markets that NEMA Member companies represent as well as those that are unique to a specific industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another part of NEMA.Lab is the development of a technical guidance document on 5G technology. This document will:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;provide relevant use cases/applications that apply across markets for electrical equipment and medical imaging manufacturers&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;identify emerging Standards and regulations related to 5G as well as appropriate end users and the benefits they receive from implementing 5G technology&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;map NEMA technical and policy priorities to help NEMA prioritize future 5G activities&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;investigate how 5G can enable services across the full spectrum of healthcare from hospitals to urgent care clinics, long-term care facilities, and individual homes&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, many of us have incorporated extra precautions into our daily routines to stay safe. Now, as state and local governments begin lifting social distancing regulations and workplaces reopen, virus prevention methods are shifting from isolation to disinfection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One common question we hear from people working on and around electrical equipment, whether in critical facilities or on the plant floor, is: How do I properly disinfect my electrical equipment?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To provide guidance, the National Electrical Manufacturers Association (NEMA) published&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/standards/view/COVID-19-Cleaning-and-Disinfecting-Guidance-for-Electrical-Equipment" class="arialabel"&gt; NEMA GD 4-2020 &lt;em&gt;COVID-19 Cleaning and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/standards/view/COVID-19-Cleaning-and-Disinfecting-Guidance-for-Electrical-Equipment" class="arialabel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disinfecting Guidance for Electrical Equipment&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; This white paper offers directions on how to clean and disinfect while preserving the functionality and integrity of most electrical equipment types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are the main takeaways from the report:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Safety First&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first consideration when cleaning and disinfecting electrical equipment is worker safety. As always, it&amp;rsquo;s important to follow safety-related codes, Standards, and legislation, along with any documented safety procedures created specifically for your facility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrical Safety Foundation International (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.ESFI.org/" class="arialabel"&gt;www.ESFI.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;), a nonprofit that promotes electrical safety in homes and workplaces, is a&amp;nbsp; good source for information on common electrical hazards and general safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next, Protect Equipment and Personnel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of this report, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) List-N disinfectant on surfaces to reduce virus contamination. However, these solutions and solvents may actually harm electrical&amp;nbsp; products and components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEMA GD 4-2020 specifically cautions against the use of fogging and spraying disinfectant solutions on and around electrical equipment because this can corrode conductive materials and degrade plastics, causing damage to equipment, outages, and even physical injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ensure your equipment and personnel remain safe by following the manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s cleaning and disinfection instructions. Keep in mind: the approved method for cleaning does not always disinfect the electrical equipment. For example, the manufacturer may recommend cleaning with a clean, dry cloth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Follow CDC Recommendations for Personal Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personnel working with and around electrical equipment should follow CDC recommendations to reduce the risk of transmission. Precautions include thorough hand-washing and the use of face coverings and other personal protective equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These protective measures are especially important when the approved cleaning method does not disinfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;When in Doubt, Reach Out&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have a specific question about cleaning and disinfecting your electrical equipment, or you have equipment in a facility with an elevated risk of virus transmission, it&amp;rsquo;s best to contact the manufacturer for guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the COVID-19 situation evolves, NEMA and its Members will continue to review all information related to best practices for cleaning and disinfecting, and will share updates to NEMA GD 4-2020 as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEMA GD 4-2020 is available as an electronic download at no cost on the NEMA website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other NEMA COVID-19 resources are available at&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/about/covid-19-response" class="arialabel"&gt; www.nema.org/about/covid-19-response&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Key points&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Know and follow safety procedures&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Follow manufacturer&amp;rsquo;s instructions for cleaning and disinfecting&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Avoid List-N chemicals unless allowed by manufacturer&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Follow CDC guidelines, including on hand-washing and use of personal protective equipment&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Consult the manufacturer with specific questions&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In March 2020, the Mexican Senate received a proposal from the government of President Andr&amp;eacute;s Manuel L&amp;oacute;pez Obrador for a new law on Standardization and metrology. On its face, the proposal for a Quality Infrastructure Law aims at modernizing, broadening, and accelerating development of mandatory and voluntary Standards in Mexico. The proposal is also intended to come into compliance with commitments made in the U.S.&amp;ndash;Mexico&amp;ndash;Canada (USMCA) trade agreement, including on use of North American and other international Standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although many details remain to be determined through the legislative process and subsequent development of implementing regulations, the Economy Secretariat intends to increase accessibility and transparency via a new online integrated technology platform for publication of Standards and conformity assessment information. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:7aac7180-b220-497c-97c8-0626938af17b</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:c1416d04-7feb-4a1b-bab7-24236372924a</guid><a10:author><a10:name> </a10:name></a10:author><category>Uncategorized</category><category>Transportation Systems</category><title>Challenges and Opportunities in Electrified Transportation</title><description>This piece was originally published in the May/June 2020 issue of electroindustry.

&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicle charging infrastructure is needed to meet growing demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;by &lt;strong&gt;John DeBoer&lt;/strong&gt;, Head of Siemens eMobility and Future Grid Business Unit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. DeBoer leads the North American eMobility and Future Grid business for Siemens and is a member of the global eMobility management team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energy landscape is shifting with the rise of renewables and decentralized energy, shaping a new energy era that is changing the way we think about electrification. The overall trend is toward decarbonization&amp;mdash;driven by regulation as well as by public opinion and action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to meet ambitious emission reduction goals, solutions will need to be pursued beyond changes in the power generation mix and at the utility level. For example, electrifying the transportation sector can significantly impact greenhouse gas emissions. The transportation sector makes up 35 percent of total U.S. energy-related emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, many of the technologies that will help reduce CO2 already exist and are deployed across the country. The difficulty lies in how, when, and where these technologies are put into use and what infrastructure will be needed to support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electric Mobility Momentum&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric vehicle (EV) growth continues at a rapid pace and is now joined by the electrification of almost every mode of transportation&amp;mdash;cars and buses, truck fleets, and even bicycles. In fact, according to the International Energy Agency, &amp;ldquo;In 2018, the global electric car fleet exceeded 5.1 million, up 2 million from the previous year and almost doubling the number of new electric car sales.&amp;rdquo; Looking ahead, &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/how-battery-storage-can-help-charge-the-electric-vehicle-market" class="arialabel"&gt;McKinsey &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;estimates that EVs, which&amp;nbsp; currently&amp;nbsp; make up less than 1 percent of the global fleet, could reach 20 percent by 2030 for cars and 12 percent for commercial vehicles. In addition, there are now more than 200 cities in the United States that are implementing the electrification of buses and transport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While it&amp;rsquo;s certainly an exciting time for the EV market, the simple fact is that the U.S. charging infrastructure is falling behind in terms of supporting such growth. The increasing number of EVs&amp;nbsp; poses new challenges for distribution grid operators, fleets, gas stations, and other charging infrastructure operators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The International Council on Clean Transportation recently reported that the expected EV growth will require an investment of more than $2.2 billion in charging infrastructure across the United States&amp;rsquo; 100 most populous metropolitan areas by 2025. The report notes that &amp;ldquo;Charging infrastructure deployment will have to grow at about 20 percent per year to meet the 2025 targets.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Which came first&amp;mdash;the vehicles or the charging stations&lt;/em&gt;? This was once a popular industry version of the chicken or the egg argument, but it&amp;rsquo;s now an obsolete and futile dispute. For consumers, the lack of charging infrastructure and the associated concern of running out of charge on the road are some of the main reasons for not purchasing EVs. Others include the lack of availability of the chargers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The demand for electric transportation can grow only as fast as the charging infrastructure enables it to. To address the charging challenge, and create an EV- ready environment, public and private sectors must collaborate at the local level and tear down barriers so that utilities can work directly with cities and extend some of the grid value back to the transit authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where there&amp;rsquo;s local investment, there&amp;rsquo;s local reward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Electrified Transportation Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/energy-and-resources/articles/power-and-utilities-industry-outlook.html" class="arialabel"&gt;Deloitte&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, &amp;ldquo;Cities may not be able to achieve their [smart city] goals without collaborating with their utilities&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;and that goes for deploying electrified transportation initiatives as well. It&amp;rsquo;s important to build the right partnerships to collaborate on the successful deployment and expansion of EV infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cities, transit authorities, automakers, facility managers, property developers, corporate fleet operators, and regulators all want to enable the electrical infrastructure to support greener transportation, and utilities need to provide a modern grid that can support it. This is creating a new electrified transportation ecosystem, one where once disparate entities now have to work together to provide a single solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One leader in driving EV adoption and infrastructure deployment is California. Most recently, the Public Utilities Commission chose to further its EV infrastructure programs by approving $54 million for local utilities like PG&amp;amp;E, SCE, SDG&amp;amp;E, and Liberty Utilities to invest in EV chargers at schools, parks, and beaches. The state is also developing a Transportation Electrification Framework to guide utilities in future programs and accelerate transport electrification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corporations and campuses that are deploying smart technology in their buildings to reduce energy costs and meet sustainability goals are now incorporating EVs and chargers into their plans. In fact, charging infrastructure is becoming one of the key assets in integrating a building to make it more effective, as their resources can be tapped for enhanced energy efficiency. EV chargers were once independent islands in the middle of a parking lot, but property developers and facility managers are now recognizing the benefits of incorporating them within their smart building deployments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While a big undertaking, these examples prove that it&amp;rsquo;s possible&amp;mdash;and that it needs to start now. We need to provide cities with the tools to create infrastructure plans that can realistically support their electric transportation goals. We need to continue active deployment of charging infrastructure to lay the groundwork for continued growth. We need to support public and private fleet managers to build charging depots holistically. We need to increase the role of electric utilities to bolster the power grid and help advance common sense Standards. And we need to engage building operators and facility managers as they deploy smart technologies in their buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the past decade has been one of significant growth for the EV market, expect 2020 to be the year the industry comes together and focuses on building those private-public partnerships to support and execute the deployment of electrified transportation infrastructure in cities across the country. The time is now, and we&amp;rsquo;re in full acceleration mode in the EV market. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:c1416d04-7feb-4a1b-bab7-24236372924a</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:16942a19-3192-4594-8b22-9d973984d5dc</guid><a10:author><a10:name> </a10:name></a10:author><category>Uncategorized</category><category>Distribution Automation</category><category>Strategic Update: C-Suite Brief</category><title>Endnotes from the President | Kevin J.

Florida is currently a &amp;ldquo;vertically integrated&amp;rdquo; market, meaning electric utilities own generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Those that own generation and transmission supply to their private distribution networks while also selling electricity to other distribution utilities through bilateral contracts. The consumers (Florida residents and businesses) have little or no choice in who provides their power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A current ballot initiative could change all that. A Petition for Electricity Choice in Florida is seeking enough signatures to allow Floridians to vote whether or not to open up the state&amp;rsquo;s wholesale (generation and transmission) and retail (distribution) markets to competition. As of December 2019, the petition has nearly 550,000 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Florida proceedings are worthy of the industry&amp;rsquo;s consideration as a microcosm of a trend in electricity markets: consumer choice. Today, most of the country&amp;rsquo;s energy markets are deregulated, and market overseers rely on generator bids to establish prices. Florida&amp;rsquo;s move in this direction would not be unique. What is of far greater interest is what might happen at the retail level. Even in deregulated markets, allowing consumers to choose who provides their electricity is rare, but it is becoming less so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Energy Information Adminisration, as of November 2018, 13 states hav&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37452" class="arialabel"&gt;e residential retail choice programs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. While the total number of participants in those programs has declined recently, more states are considering implementing such programs, and current programs are considering expanding (i.e., to include more retail choice capacity or to include non-residential customers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of customer choice expands far beyond the supplier. For example, the RE 100 is a group of well over 200 U.S. companies that have pledged to purchase solely renewable energy. Companies like IKEA, Apple, Kellogg&amp;rsquo;s, and Morgan Stanley are on the list. With enough purchasing power to dictate preferences, even in non-consumer choice distribution networks, these companies are moving markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virtually every state now allows consumers to make at least some decisions about the energy they consume, beyond the simple question of quantity. With advanced metering infrastructure and time-of-use opt-in clauses, optional demand response programs, and net metering, the concept of consumer control is becoming more and more prevalent. Demand for equipment and systems that can efficiently and effectively enable that control will continue to grow. Smart meters, distributed energy resource management, and advanced distribution management systems are just some examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do not know what Florida&amp;rsquo;s final ballot wording will look like come November. Nor can I predict the &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; balance between competition and monopoly in energy markets. But I do know that energy consumers collectively have more energy choices than ever before. How users apply that power is up to them. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><itunes:author xmlns:itunes="http://www.itunes.com/dtds/podcast-1.0.dtd">NEMAcast</itunes:author><post-id>urn:uuid:16942a19-3192-4594-8b22-9d973984d5dc</post-id></item><item><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:a3ee4662-3fa3-473d-9fe4-764d2d7db6c6</guid><a10:author><a10:name> </a10:name></a10:author><category>Uncategorized</category><category>Building Infrastructure</category><category>Electrical Code</category><title>Endnotes from the President | Kevin J.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="alignright wp-image-4560 size-full" src="/images/default-source/blogimages/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/from-the-president-kevin-j-cosgriff.jpg" alt="From-the-President-Kevin-J-Cosgriff" width="250" height="319"&gt;The electricity sector may account for only 2 percent of U.S. GDP, but the other 98 percent of the economy depends on it virtually 100 percent of the time. Behind the electronics and electrical products that power modern life are essential—but largely out-of-sight—building infrastructure technologies. Said differently: “What’s behind your walls?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact these quality products have on modern commerce and society cannot be restated often enough—NEMA Members power our country’s economy all the while doing so safely, reliably, and efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is more to come. The Internet of Things and electrification more broadly are introducing new products, sensors, and connected devices. Increasingly these products include sensitive and expensive onboard computers and digital controls that will need special levels of surety such as from surge protectors. This cost- effective capability can prevent downtime, improve system and data reliability, and all but eliminate equipment damage due to transients and surges for both power and signal lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The average home in the U.S. conservatively has $15,000 worth of equipment that can be damaged by surges. but it is a common misconception that only lightning causes surges. And while surges, from lightning account for some 20 percent of events, many people think it is the leading cause. More than 80 percent of surges originate from internal building sources, such as those caused by starting and stopping any electrical load. And a whopping one billion dollars of insurance claims per year result when these sensitive pieces of equipment are not properly safeguarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NEMA successfully advocated for the inclusion of surge protective devices in   the &lt;em&gt;National Electrical Code&lt;/em&gt;®, which has been updated to add requirements for surge mitigation in residential dwellings. Further, NEMA recently published&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="/standards/view/Part-1-E2-80-94Surge-Protective-Device-Specification-Guide-for-Low-Voltage-Power-Distribution-Systems" class="arialabel"&gt; NEMA SPD 1.1-2019 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surge Protective Device Specification Guide for Low Voltage Power Distribution Systems&lt;/em&gt;, which educates users, provides clear guidance on how to specify these devices, and encourages contractors to purchase the reliably high-quality ones made by NEMA Members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I urge you to join NEMA in promoting these sorts of products and systems by taking the opportunity to ask audiences of various types, “What’s behind your walls?” For more information about any of these activities, please contact Danny Abbate, NEMA Industry Director for Building Infrastructure (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:daniel.abbate@nema.org" class="arialabel"&gt;daniel.abbate@nema.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). To join NEMA, contact Vi Lilly, Membership Director (&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:vi.lilly@nema.org" class="arialabel"&gt;vi.lilly@nema.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;). &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Bob Dylan’s title track song from his 1964 record says, “The Times They Are a-Changin’.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a child of the ’60s, I loved the show The Jetsons. Futuristic items like teleconferencing, robotics, drones, smartwatches, and holograms seemed so farfetched back then. Today, technologies like these can be delivered to our homes in two days or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond Hollywood’s predictions, we are seeing other wondrous technologies enter our world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sensors are going to be the latest infrastructure foundation our future is built upon—just six years ago there were roughly 10 million sensors, and today there are more than 3.5 billion. Some predicted this number to be more than a trillion in less than five years. We should consider their importance to be equal to that of previous infrastructure developments like our electrical grid and highway system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and quantum physics, the amount of data and  new technology that will be incorporated into this infrastructure over the next few years boggles the mind and is limited only by the imagination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are already seeing new technologies in the market that allow building owners to reduce energy utilization by quickly documenting the power consumption of every single electrical device within a facility. Soon, these technologies will proactively identify future electrical equipment failures before they even happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Connectivity is advancing how we look at not only luxuries but also survivability. For example, beds are already available today that monitor  our vitals and transmit them to the cloud via smart thermostats. Eventually, countless lives will be saved with this technology once predictive analytics are incorporated. For heart attack victims, emergency response teams will be notified faster, but the end goal is to use the data to provide early warnings that a heart attack is likely to occur within a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where will this all lead? What else can we expect to see in tomorrow’s building infrastructure?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the short and simple answer is the future will look like what we want it to look like. In the end, different people want different things, and  I believe our economy has the horsepower to deliver them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers have been and always will be inventive. Artificial intelligence, predictive analytics, and quantum physics are all in overdrive. It is easy to imagine that moving objects from Seattle to Miami in an hour, replacing crop production in the San Joaquin Valley to just a few miles of vertical farming, and harvesting energy from space-based power stations are all within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us to a position where the eyes begin to glaze over. What will new technology bring  us? What will be the new disruptive technologies, and how can one get ahead of the game, whether from a business perspective or an investment perspective? Because technological change tends to happen so quickly, I think the idiom of not seeing the forest for the trees is never more applicable for executives than when considering topics like these. However, if we were to take a long, hard look at the big picture, I believe most would realize that these changes are not something to be feared but, rather, embraced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vast majority of new technologies really  boil down to two categories ... faster and more accessible. Five-column ledgers became adding machines, which became computers, which became supercomputers we carry around in our pockets. They are faster and more accessible, but they still perform the same function. The future of building infrastructure will be the same way. Just as a kid watching &lt;em&gt;The Jetsons &lt;/em&gt;in the ’60s, the technologies will be amazing to see, but the net gain will simply be something that is faster and more accessible. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And over the past three years, the yearly frequency of billion-dollar disaster events has doubled the long-term average.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; With storm data demonstrating a pattern of increasingly extreme weather, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance this isn&amp;rsquo;t an aberration; we may be seeing the new &amp;ldquo;extreme&amp;rdquo; normal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter what, hurricanes, wildfires, blizzards, and other extreme events will happen again. Following&amp;nbsp; best practices for preparation is the best way to protect the electrical infrastructure of the buildings where we live, work, and play. This article explores some key best practices and industry guidance on how to protect your electrical equipment against natural disasters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Standards Enhance Safety&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry codes and Standards provide useful guidance on the proper installation, maintenance, servicing, and operation of electrical equipment. When it comes to disaster event planning, these Standards recommend starting with a risk assessment to understand the potential site exposure and system impact from disaster events. For example, Article 708 of the &lt;em&gt;National Electrical Code&lt;/em&gt;&amp;reg; (NEC) contains requirements for designated critical operations areas. These are mission- critical buildings or areas where disruption would impact national security, public health, or safety. A documented risk assessment and associated mitigation strategy is the starting point for providing the&amp;nbsp; necessary safety and evaluation of code compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although general businesses are not required to follow the rules in Article 708, the completion of a risk assessment will provide needed guidance when creating plans for disaster events and recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To keep your facility safe and operable, the NEC includes the key items that a  &lt;a href="https://blog.se.com/energy-management-energy-efficiency/2017/05/04/power-system-assessments-address-risk-reliability-relationship/" class="arialabel" data-sf-ec-immutable="" data-sf-marked=""&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; should identify:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Potential hazards (whether from a natural disaster or human error)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The likelihood of their occurrence&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The vulnerability of the system to the identified hazards&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;An essential part of the risk assessment is evaluating where specific equipment is located or positioned. For example, when considering flood damage exposure, the assessment may lead to having backup generators and associated fuel pumps elevated to be kept safe. During Hurricane Katrina, for instance, flooding knocked out basement generators in a New Orleans hospital, leading to an emergency evacuation of all patients.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completion of a risk assessment should be followed by a mitigation strategy that addresses what equipment and actions should be included in an electrical emergency action plan and the events that would trigger these actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Crafting the Right Plan&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guidance on creating a natural disaster plan for your site can be found in NFPA 1600 &lt;em&gt;Standard on Continuity, Emergency, and Crisis Management&lt;/em&gt;. NFPA 1600 provides a method on how to create an electrical emergency action plan to save facilities from experiencing too much downtime. The action plan also:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Reduces time to restore short- and long-term power quickly and safely&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Minimizes uncertainty when a disaster occurs&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Increases understanding of electrical assets, available emergency services, and replacement market availability&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it takes a lot of time and thought to develop an action plan, doing so is fundamental to restoring power safely. To build a successful action plan, facility managers should approach its development by thinking about what they need both within a facility and outside of it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internally: &lt;/strong&gt;Teams need to define the emergency criteria clearly, whether it&amp;rsquo;s the damage from a natural disaster or even tripping circuit breakers that can affect productivity. They must also identify mission-critical electrical equipment and list these within the plan and associated documentation, such as the facility single-line Once the teams identify the mission-critical pieces of electrical equipment, they should perform analysis on each of these assets to assess availability in the market, lead times, and a plan of action when the equipment is no longer functional.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With external partners: &lt;/strong&gt;It is important that facility managers maintain relationships with external partners and pre-negotiate emergency service contracts with outside vendors. This way, they do not fall victim to overpricing and insufficient support in the wake of a natural disaster. Facility managers should also clearly state internal and external responsibilities, such as providing electrical one-line diagrams, energization procedures, and coordination and communication activities between multiple vendors. Other factors that should be pre-determined include defining the equipment and service scope, the timeframe of the emergency contract (including expiration date), and contact information.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an effective action plan in place, facility managers have the tools and strategies needed to get their facilities back to a functional state, but doing this safely needs to be a priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="[images%7COpenAccessDataProvider]f613ed10-2325-452a-b55b-562ea4183348" height="420" class="aligncenter wp-image-6304 size-full" width="700" alt="2018-billion-dollar-disaster-map" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Source: &amp;ldquo;Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters: Overview,&amp;rdquo; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Centers for Environmental Information, 2019,&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/" class="arialabel" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Safety Takes a Front Seat&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the disaster strikes, it&amp;rsquo;s all hands on deck to restore the facility and get business operations back to normal. But with flooding and other damage, safety, not the speed of recovery, should be the top priority for all employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employees must be trained. &lt;/strong&gt;They should properly examine equipment that may have been affected by flooding, fire, blizzards, or other impacts, and determine if it needs repair or replacement. They should rely on the experience of qualified personnel and act by guidelines set by NFPA 70E &lt;em&gt;Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Employees should not clean and then reuse damaged equipment. &lt;/strong&gt;Damaged electrical equipment is dangerous to handle. Even applying cleaning agents or abrasives to electrical equipment to remove debris or residue is likely to do more harm than good. Keep in mind that using damaged equipment can result in system failure and harm people and property.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consult a professional. &lt;/strong&gt;Qualified personnel should be on-site to evaluate, replace, and repair damaged equipment. Electrical professionals can inspect the system for hidden damage and ensure proper system operation and safety.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses that prepare properly for natural disasters are in the best position to quickly and safely return&amp;nbsp; to normal operation. With the damage of natural disasters being largely unpredictable, it&amp;rsquo;s important for facility managers to have the proper plans in place to mitigate the risk, plan for an emergency, and restore electric power once the disaster has ended. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-----------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;Weather,&amp;rdquo; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/weather" class="arialabel" data-sf-ec-immutable=""&gt;https://www.noaa.gov/weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Adam B.

&lt;p&gt;Mike Logsdon has more than 30 years of industry experience in electric motors and power transmission equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transportation sector’s systems are rapidly moving away from internal combustion engines and toward electrification. Engineers now have many design and performance options thanks to significant advances in electric motor and control technologies. They can prioritize performance requirements and their understanding of design tradeoffs to make the best choice. For a successful electrification program, here are a few main considerations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, engineers must choose the form factor required for the electric motor. These form factors include radial with internal rotor (traditional motor), radial with external rotor (commonly used in motorized fans), axial (thin, flat form factor), or conical (a mix between radial and axial). Engineers make these decisions mostly based on size and weight requirements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Radial machines are best when smaller diameters are required and axial length is not as&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Axial machines are best when minimum axial length is critical and diameter is flexible. Axial machines are also well suited for high torque and high-efficiency direct drive applications due to their larger diameter and inherently high pole count.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once form factor is determined, engineers must next consider motor electromagnetics. Options include induction, permanent magnet (PMAC, PMDC, or brushed dc), and reluctance type (switched reluctance or synchronous reluctance). Many factors go into selecting the right type of motor, including efficiency, torque, speed, power density, battery life, reliability, gearing, and total system cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In parallel with motor selection, engineers must consider control topology and location of the control. The “control” typically consists of the power electronics that provide voltage and current to drive the motor as well as electronics that interpret input signals and control the power electronics. Variable frequency drives or inverters that use pulse wave modulation that vary the speed of the motor typically drive induction motors and most permanent magnet motors. Characteristic transportation applications may use centralized controls that drive multiple motors or a configuration of motors with their integrated controls. The physical layout of the vehicle and application parameters such as ingress protection, temperature, vibration, performance, reliability, and system cost usually determines the selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="aligncenter wp-image-6145 size-full" src="/images/default-source/blogimages/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/performance-factors-in-electrified-transportation-systems.gif" alt="performance-factors-in-electrified-transportation-systems" width="700" height="271"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relative comparison of motor type for given performance factors in electrified transportation systems&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The good news is that there are many options for a system engineer to choose from when designing an electrified vehicle. Options exist with today’s technology that can easily meet—or even far exceed— the performance of existing internal combustion engine designs. Perhaps the biggest challenge is energy storage onboard the vehicle; this can be accomplished by battery power alone or by also using a small internal combustion engine in a hybrid approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;System efficiency is paramount in selecting the right design. While most motor and control manufacturers have a very broad portfolio of ac motors and controls, they have developed few options for mobile applications with dc inputs. Custom designs may be attractive from a form factor and performance standpoint but cost more until manufacturers achieve significant production volumes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motor and control manufacturers are rapidly developing cost-effective, high-performance Standardized platforms for vehicle electrification. Overall, the future is bright for electrification in  the transportation sector, and we can expect to see electrified vehicles of all types in the near future. &lt;strong&gt;ei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="size-full wp-image-4617" src="/images/default-source/blogimages/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/circular-economy-and-materials-in-buildings.jpg" alt="Circular-Economy-and-Materials-in-Buildings" width="700" height="315"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Kohorst, Senior Manager, Environment, Health &amp;amp; Safety, NEMA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The notion of a circular economy (CE) is emerging as a dominant template for crafting environmental policy in key global markets. Restorative and regenerative by design, it seeks to move beyond the traditional “take, make, dispose” approach that characterizes most economic systems. Instead, the aim becomes buying less and reusing more by keeping products, components, and materials at their highest utility and value at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The European Union was an early and earnest promoter of the CE concept, adopting an ambitious Circular Economy Package in December 2015 that included legislative proposals on waste and an action plan to support circular processes in each step of the value chain. The CE movement in the United States—although not established in federal law—has been spurred by influential support from the business community. In Canada, it is advancing through public–private partnerships as well as policies adopted at the provincial level.&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" class="arialabel"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;,&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" class="arialabel"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Strategic Initiative will examine the implications of the CE concept for electrical products and systems, with particular focus on the selection of materials and product recyclability. It is intended to build on the work of a prior NEMA SI on Environmental and Health Product Declarations (EPD/HPD), which addressed the use of lifecycle analysis and hazard assessment to enhance the transparency of building products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on the expertise within Member companies as well as outside consultants, this SI will produce a materials use and end-of-life management report to help Members assess the impact of their products and investigate ecologically friendly materials. The work will include a review of U.S. recycling laws and programs as well as European CE regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patrick A. Hope, Executive Director, MITA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Hope has held government relations positions within medical specialty societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With new developments continuing to push the boundaries for medical imaging and related devices, technological innovation has completely changed the healthcare landscape. Below are a few of the many developments that are helping doctors and patients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Software-Aided Diagnosis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patient privacy is a huge focus for equipment manufacturers and hospitals, so technologies that make it easier to protect data and securely exchange information are making waves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity startup &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://techstartups.com/2018/06/29/medcrypt-raises-1-9-million-to-accelerate-commercial-deployment-of-cryptographically-embedded-cybersecurity-software-for-medical-device-makers/" class="arialabel"&gt;MedCrypt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, for example, developed software that will protect the security of all medical devices. Researchers from &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/news/2018/team-develops-capabilities-more-secure-blockchain/" class="arialabel"&gt;Vanderbilt University&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; are investigating the possibilities of using blockchain technology to safeguard patient data and hospital communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protecting patient data isn’t the only benefit provided by new technologies, as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning are making it possible for computer-aided diagnosis (CADx). A handful of CADx programs have been FDA approved, with applications ranging from &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.heartflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HeartFlow-Article-Technology-Safian-FINAL.pdf" class="arialabel"&gt;coronary computed tomography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; (CT) analysis to &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.viz.ai" class="arialabel"&gt;stroke detection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As new data becomes available, and AI becomes more powerful, a host of technologies will emerge to assist doctors in recognizing and treating any number of patient conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Imaging Innovation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancement in imaging technology is pushing the bounds of current modalities. Development of a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/versatile_ultrasound_system_could_transform_how_do/" class="arialabel"&gt;new ultrasound device&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; that substitutes optical probes for the traditional electronic ones means that the device can be used in tandem with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a feature that eludes current models because of the effect of the magnetic field on electronic systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another multimodal system that has recently been unveiled is a &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2018/versatile_ultrasound_system_could_transform_how_do/" class="arialabel"&gt;coronary CT angiography&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt; / cardiac single-photon emission CT (SPECT) perfusion combinational approach that provides doctors with vital information on blood flow to and from the heart tissue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ultrasound, typically thought of as an imaging method, can also be used in the treatment of a variety of conditions. By utilizing high-intensity focused ultrasound, doctors can destroy problematic tissues in an accurate and entirely non-invasive manner. As doctors and researchers continue to investigate the power of this technique, we will likely see additional treatment applications emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;PET Imaging&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the use of ultrasound technology for both imaging and treatment, new developments in the field of nuclear medicine combine the therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities of the radiopharmaceuticals in a model known as theranostics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerful example has been the diagnosis and treatment of neuroendocrine cancer. Positron emission tomography (PET) can also act as an early detection method for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) because the buildup of specific peptides and proteins in the brain that is linked to AD can be directly imaged using &lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1186/s13024-017-0162-3" class="arialabel"&gt;different tracer drugs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;. The importance of early AD diagnosis cannot be understated. As medical technology advances, we hope to find a cure for this disease.&lt;/p&gt;
